# Pet Scales Alexa Skill

## Summary

You've arrived at the source repository for the Pet Scales Alexa Skill. The purpose of this skill is to have a handy assistant to track how much food your pet is receiving. I am a dog owner of two, however work patterns between myself and my wife mean we're constantly asking when the dogs were last fed etc. Let's have Alexa deal with that.

## Features

Records your pets meals in grams

```
Alexa, open Pet Scales
Tara ate 30 grams
```

```
Alexa, ask Pet Scales to add 20 grams for Snowy
```

Lets you know their daily total

```
Alexa, ask Pet Scales how much my pets have eaten today
```

## TODO

 - [ ] Add contribution instructions.
 - [ ] Better handling of pet name. Maybe per user confirm their pet names with spell out and cache in Elasticache.
 - [ ] I'd like to track feeding against manufacturers recommendations.
 - [ ] Notify the companion app of running total per feed.
